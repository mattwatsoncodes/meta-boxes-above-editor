Move meta boxes above the editor field (below the title) by adding 'primary' as a context value.

== Description ==

Designed initially to work with [CMB2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/cmb2/), but will work with any manually added Custom Meta Box.

Adds a new 'Postbox Container' to WordPress above the editor (`postbox-container-0`) to render meta boxes above the editor (below the title).

Simply add a value of 'primary' as the context value for the meta boxes to appear.
